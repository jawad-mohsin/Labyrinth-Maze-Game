## Introduction
This project, titled "Labyrinth Maze Game," is developed as part of the CSC-221 Data Structures and Algorithm course at Bahria University, Karachi Campus. The maze game utilizes the A* algorithm to find the shortest path from a starting point to a goal within the maze.

## Paradigms
The project explores various paradigms for implementing a labyrinth or maze game, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), A* Algorithm, Recursive Backtracking, Randomized Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, and Divide and Conquer.

## Algorithm & Explanation
The A* algorithm is employed to find the shortest path from a starting point to a goal in the maze. The algorithm combines the strengths of both breadth-first and depth-first search, using a heuristic function to guide the search and prioritize paths to explore.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into multiple forms, each serving a specific purpose in the maze game. The main forms include:
- **Splash Form**: Displays a loading screen when the application starts.
- **Main Menu Form**: Provides options to start the game, view instructions, or quit.
- **Difficulty Level Form**: Allows the selection of the game difficulty level.
- **Game Form (Labyrinth)**: Implements the maze game logic using the A* algorithm.
- **Instructions Form**: Displays rules and instructions for the game.
- **Retry Form**: Appears when the player fails a level, providing options to retry or return to the main menu.
- **Win Form**: Appears when the player successfully completes a level, offering options to proceed to the next level, return to the main menu, or quit.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jawad-mohsin/Labyrinth-Maze-Game.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
3. Build and run the project.
